# Shoppin

## Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Adham Mohamed**.

This is a shopping website made with *React.js* as a task for [Scandiweb](https://scandiweb.com/).

It uses *Apollo* to fetch data from a *GraphQL* endpoint, populating a responsive UI, while using *Redux* to manage its state and *React Router* for a SPA experience.

## View Website

You can view the website live on https://shoppin-scandi.netlify.app/.

## Run Code

You need *Node.js* and *npm* in order to build and run the project.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run website
npm start

```
